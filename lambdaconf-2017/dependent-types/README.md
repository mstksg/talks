Enhancing Your Haskell With Dependently Typed Programming
=========================================================

*A Case Study With Neural Networks*

> Dependently-typed Haskell is all about pushing the limits of how much power
> your types have to verify that your code is correct, direct you in writing
> code, enhance your productivity, and encode meaning in type signatures. In
> this session, we will explore its practical benefits by applying these
> principles to building verified neural networks. We look at neural networks
> with and without dependent types, show how to add dependently typed benefits
> incrementally, and clearly show the benefits that we can directly apply to
> many different applications. This session is geared less toward the
> theoretical idea of dependent types and more toward hitting the ground
> running with immediate benefits in existing code bases.
>
> Developers will learn the basic concepts of dependent types, existential
> types, type-level proofs, and working with the “singletons” library, as well
> as high-level concepts in dependently typed development.
>
> Super-charge the correctness of your code incrementally and find new ways to
> make the compiler work for you today!
