> Let's scratch the surface of the power of Richard Eisenberg's
> *singletons* library and peek through the doors of opportunity that it
> opens for us. Learn things you can directly apply now, and also build
> a foundation for future learning.
>
> Look past the hype and see how the singletons library can benefit your
> programs today through type safety and dependently typed programming!

*A Case Study With Neural Networks*

> Dependently-typed Haskell is all about pushing the limits of how much
> power your types have to verify that your code is correct, direct you
> in writing code, enhance your productivity, and encode meaning in type
> signatures. In this session, we will explore its practical benefits by
> applying these principles to building verified neural networks. We
> look at neural networks with and without dependent types, show how to
> add dependently typed benefits incrementally, and clearly show the
> benefits that we can directly apply to many different applications.
> This session is geared less toward the theoretical idea of dependent
> types and more toward hitting the ground running with immediate
> benefits in existing code bases.
>
> Developers will learn the basic concepts of dependent types,
> existential types, type-level proofs, and working with the
> “singletons” library, as well as high-level concepts in dependently
> typed development.
>
> Super-charge the correctness of your code incrementally and find new
> ways to make the compiler work for you today!
