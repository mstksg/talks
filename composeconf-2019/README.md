> Free Structures – including Free Monoids and Free Monads – are a great
> example of a tool from mathematics that have been shown to be very
> useful as concepts in Haskell. Free structures of all sorts give you
> powerful tools in program composition, implementation, and safety
> guarantees. This talk shows how the implementation of a ubiquitous
> tool in programming, the Regular Expression, becomes almost trivial to
> implement when using an often-overlooked free structure, the Free
> Alternative. Through this accessible example, we explore the specific
> benefits of choosing to use a free structure for our implementation
> over other potential methods, and take a look into the philosophy of
> what makes free structures (of all types) such a powerful tool for
> programming.
