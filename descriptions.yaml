    title: Applicative Regular Expressions using the Free Alternative
    description: |
      > Free Structures – including Free Monoids and Free Monads – are a great example
      > of a tool from mathematics that have been shown to be very useful as concepts
      > in Haskell. Free structures of all sorts give you powerful tools in program
      > composition, implementation, and safety guarantees. This talk shows how the
      > implementation of a ubiquitous tool in programming, the Regular Expression,
      > becomes almost trivial to implement when using an often-overlooked free
      > structure, the Free Alternative. Through this accessible example, we explore
      > the specific benefits of choosing to use a free structure for our
      > implementation over other potential methods, and take a look into the
      > philosophy of what makes free structures (of all types) such a powerful tool
      > for programming.

      Talk given at [C◦mp◦se Conference][cc2019], in New York City.

    title: Dependently Typed Programming Introduction (at Kiev Functional programming)
    description: |
      Talk given at Kievfprog, August 16th 2017, on seeing how dependent types
      can help you in your everyday practical code!  Based on my [LambdaConf
      2017][] talk.

        description: |
          > Let's scratch the surface of the power of Richard Eisenberg's *singletons*
          > library and peek through the doors of opportunity that it opens for us. Learn
          > things you can directly apply now, and also build a foundation for future
          > learning.
          >
          > Look past the hype and see how the singletons library can benefit your
          > programs today through type safety and dependently typed programming!

        title: Enhancing Your Haskell With Dependently Typed Programming
        description: |
          *A Case Study With Neural Networks*

          > Dependently-typed Haskell is all about pushing the limits of how much power
          > your types have to verify that your code is correct, direct you in writing
          > code, enhance your productivity, and encode meaning in type signatures. In
          > this session, we will explore its practical benefits by applying these
          > principles to building verified neural networks. We look at neural networks
          > with and without dependent types, show how to add dependently typed benefits
          > incrementally, and clearly show the benefits that we can directly apply to
          > many different applications. This session is geared less toward the
          > theoretical idea of dependent types and more toward hitting the ground
          > running with immediate benefits in existing code bases.
          >
          > Developers will learn the basic concepts of dependent types, existential
          > types, type-level proofs, and working with the “singletons” library, as well
          > as high-level concepts in dependently typed development.
          >
          > Super-charge the correctness of your code incrementally and find new ways to
          > make the compiler work for you today!
